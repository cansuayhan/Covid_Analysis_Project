# Covid Analysis Project

Covid 19 Data Exploration using `MySQL` and Data Visualization using `Tableau`.

## SQL

`Skills used in SQL:` Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

`Link to dataset:` https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

I created 2 excels from this dataset names as `Coviddeaths` and `CovidVaccinations`. Dont forget to check dataset and format if needed.

You can get these datasets inside this repository, file name `Covid_RAW_file`
Tip: You need to use .csv file if you are importing the file to MySQL.

## Tableau

You can find the queries to use for our visiualization folder name as `Covid Tableau Project.`

You need to run each query, and export each table as shown below. You can use these files to import into Tableau. ( I am using Tableau Public, thats why ı am doing it this way)
